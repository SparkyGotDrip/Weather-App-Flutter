# Weather-App-Flutter

A remixed, cloned minimal weather app written in Flutter. Originally created by Hussain Mustafa with a video guide that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wTl0yqgBzU&t=1s).

## Getting Started
To run it, you just have to generate an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) by signing up for a free account.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
